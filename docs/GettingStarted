Getting Started Guide


Open AND READ all documentation in this folder.

The documentation at http://www.mesa3d.org/ is pretty helpful, too.

Mesa3d has a pretty weird build system. At least, one that isn't supported by Alchemy without some hacking.

The important files:

src/c/mesa3d/Mesa/src/mesa/drivers/x11, the xLib driver, which the Flash driver will likely be built on.
src/c/mesa3d/Mesa/configs/flash, which contains the build configuration.

Note: now that I'm looking at this again it probably makes sense to build the driver based on Off-screen rendering (OSMesa).
