[PREFACE]

Mesa has a weird, complex build system. It takes a little work to wrap your head around.

But at a high level we're compiling with a modified version of the linux-osmesa-static configuration. That's the 24-bit off-screen Mesa renderer.

("8-bit color channels" == 8-bits PER channel)

OSMesa is a very simple driver which exposes a 24-bit display buffer, that we can then map to a BitmapData object.

From the OSMesa guide: "If you need to compile on a non-Linux platform, copy [Mesa/configs/linux-osmesa-static] to a new config file and edit it as needed. Then, add the new config name to the top-level Makefile."
http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html

So we need to make a copy of the config, correct it for alchemy, and add it to the list of accepted configurations.

By default the build system tries to use its own mklib binary. This MUST be changed to use Alchemy's ar.

Once that's done, build to generate a ".a" file -- a static library. In the test application write the hooks for Flash and link against the lib when compiling to a SWC.

Note: there were quite a few problems getting this to compile with the right system headers. So I had to add two include directories: the standard Alchemy includes, and the llvm-gcc includes, which is pretty deep in the Alchemy hierarchy.

On top of that, I had to add checks for type definitions. It appears Alchemy isn't honoring HAVE_STDINT_H, so I had to add some #ifdef's to keep the compiler from defining the types twice.

I basically spent a night trying every combination of standard system directives until I found what worked. For reference, see x_SKIP_P_COMPILER_TYPES, SKIP_P_COMPILER_TYPES, and #define _SYS_TYPES_H_. Not fun.

I also had to add #include <sys/types.h> to some select files, as well as manually disable threads in p_thread.h


Build steps:

Library ==> osmesa.a

Test.c + osmesa.a ==> SWC

SWC + AS3 Wrapper ==> Demo




[HOW TO BUILD]

In the root of the C Mesa folder, do:

make realclean && make flash

Thats it! You should now have a bunch of .a files in the folders.

SEE ALSO: the makefile in the Mesa root's parent directory.



[EARLY BUILD ATTEMPT]

Generating the first autoconf file

This is the minimal static configuration:
LDFLAGS="-emit-llvm" CFLAGS="-emit-llvm" ./configure --prefix="$ALCHEMY_HOME/usr/local/" --disable-asm --with-driver="xlib" enable_shared="no" enable_static="yes"

Now rename the "autoconf" makefile in configs/ to "flash" and modify the necessary properties:
Define "FLASH" directive, remove C standard def, remove xlib references and sources
